```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export function useJobItems(searchText: string) {
  const [jobItems, setJobItems] = useState([]);

  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const jobItemsSliced = jobItems.slice(0, 7);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!searchText) return;
    const fetchData = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://bytegrad.com/course-assets/projects/rmtdev/api/data?search=${searchText}`
      );

      const data = await response.json();
      setIsLoading(false);
      setJobItems(data.jobItems);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, [searchText]);

  return {
    jobItemsSliced,
    isLoading,
  };
}
```

In the code snippet you provided, the `jobItemsSliced` state is derived from the existing `jobItems` state. Hereâ€™s a detailed note on how this derivation is achieved:

### State Derivation from Existing State

#### Context

The `useJobItems` hook is designed to manage the fetching and state of job items based on the `searchText` input. It maintains two primary states:

- `jobItems`: An array of job items fetched from an API.
- `isLoading`: A boolean that indicates whether the data is currently being fetched.

#### Derivation Process

1. **Fetching Data**

   - The `useEffect` hook is triggered whenever `searchText` changes. It fetches data from an API, updates `jobItems` with the fetched data, and toggles `isLoading` to reflect the loading state.

2. **State Derivation**

   - **`jobItemsSliced`**: This is a derived state that is computed from the `jobItems` array. It is defined as:
     ```javascript
     const jobItemsSliced = jobItems.slice(0, 7);
     ```
   - **Purpose**: `jobItemsSliced` provides a subset of the `jobItems` array, specifically the first 7 items. This can be useful for scenarios where you want to display a limited number of items (e.g., for pagination or to reduce the amount of data shown at once).

3. **Why Derive State?**

   - **Performance**: By slicing the array, you limit the number of items processed or rendered at any given time. This can improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
   - **User Experience**: Displaying only a subset of items can enhance the user experience by avoiding overwhelming the user with too much information at once. It also allows for features like pagination to be implemented easily.

4. **Consistency**
   - **Single Source of Truth**: The original state (`jobItems`) remains the source of truth for all job items. `jobItemsSliced` is derived from this state and does not mutate the original array, ensuring consistency and immutability.
   - **Dynamic Updates**: Since `jobItemsSliced` is computed from the latest `jobItems`, it automatically updates whenever `jobItems` changes. This ensures that the subset of job items displayed is always in sync with the fetched data.

### Summary

In the `useJobItems` hook, `jobItemsSliced` is a derived state that is computed from the existing `jobItems` array using the `slice` method. This derivation allows you to work with a subset of data efficiently, improving performance and user experience, while keeping the original state intact and consistent.
