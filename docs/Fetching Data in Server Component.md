In Next.js, using a server component to fetch data is a great approach because it allows you to leverage server-side rendering (SSR) for better performance and SEO benefits. It avoids using client-side hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` to fetch data, which can simplify your code and reduce the complexity of managing state.

### Example of Fetching Data in a Server Component

To make the component more efficient and simpler, you can directly fetch the data in a server component by making it `async`. Here's how to rewrite your `AnimalTableContainer` component using server-side data fetching:

```typescript
// AnimalTableContainer.tsx
import { TAnimal } from "@/lib/types";
import AnimalsDataTable from "./AnimalsDataTable";
import { animalColumns } from "./AnimalTableColumns";
import prisma from "@/lib/db";  // Assuming this is your Prisma client setup

// Fetch the data directly in the server component
async function AnimalTableContainer() {
  // Fetch data on the server side
  const animals: TAnimal[] = await prisma.animal.findMany();

  return (
    <div>
      <AnimalsDataTable data={animals} columns={animalColumns} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default AnimalTableContainer;
```

### Key Changes and Improvements

1. **Make Component Async:**
   - The `AnimalTableContainer` component is now an `async` function. This allows us to use `await` directly to fetch data from the database.

2. **Fetch Data on the Server Side:**
   - By calling `prisma.animal.findMany()` directly, we fetch the data on the server side. This is efficient because the data fetching happens during the server-side rendering process, and the component is returned with data already populated.

3. **No Client-Side State or Hooks Needed:**
   - We avoid using `useEffect` or `useState` for data fetching, which simplifies the code and reduces the risk of bugs related to managing client-side state.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Performance:** Fetching data on the server side eliminates the need for client-side fetching and makes the initial page load faster.
- **SEO:** Since data is fetched on the server, search engines can index the page content more effectively.
- **Simpler Code:** The component logic is straightforward without the complexity of state management or lifecycle hooks.
- **Error Handling:** You can handle server-side errors more gracefully, and users won't see loading states or flickers that can happen with client-side data fetching.

By fetching data directly in the server component, you take full advantage of Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities. This approach is efficient, clean, and often the best choice for fetching data in a React server component.
